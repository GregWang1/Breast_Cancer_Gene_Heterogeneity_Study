# Breast Cancer Gene Heterogeneity Study
Breast Cancer Gene Heterogeneity Case Study by NGS (Next-Generation Sequencing)

## Project & Work Product Description: 
    • Get it working (this project was originally created by someone else)
    • Goal #1 is to get it running, and fix things if they didn't quite work right.
    • Get more news
    • Make sure the voice parts work

## Lessons Learned: [optional here, can be put at the end.]

[ Hyperlinks to more detailed project description information can be linked to documents in subfolders in the github repository. ]:

## Description of Solution:
    •	Software functions for solving problem(s) step by step.
    •	Workflow diagram of future ("TO-BE") state (improved processes from your solution).
    •	"Minimum Viable Product" (MVP) 1.0 delivered.  (V1.x delivered beyond MVP V1.0?)
    •	Later MVP, i.e., v2, v3, vN+ functionality to be delivered? 
            • additional requirements, GUI, usability, etc. for later versions

### Solution Design (high-level):


```python

```

### Solution Code Description: 
    •	Describe code (to help users understand it.)
    •	Hyperlinks to actual complete code  

## Application Use: ***(Instructions for How to Use The Software)*** 
    If your application applies to multiple use cases, list and briefly describe each major use case. 

### Application Use - ***Tips & Tricks***:    

    If it is not obvious or documentation is not built into the user interface (or written in a Jupyter Notebook), then briefly describe each major use case.  Minor variations can be left out.
